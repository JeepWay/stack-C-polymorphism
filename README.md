# Implementation of a Stack with Function Pointers to Simulate Polymorphism in C Language

## Description
* The stack is implemented using array.
* The stack uses function pointers to simulate polymorphism in C language.
* The function pointers are used to point to the real implementation of common stack operations, e.g., push, pop, and top, like [std::stack](https://cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/) in C++.
* This project is default to support the data type of `int`, `char`, and `string`, but it can be easily extended to support other data types, e.g., `float`, `double` and so on.
